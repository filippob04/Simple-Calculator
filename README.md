## Technical Details ‚öôÔ∏è

The application is structured using a simple state machine approach in JavaScript:

* `display.textContent`: Stores the current visible input/result.
* `firstOperand`: Stores the first number of the current operation.
* `currentOperator`: Stores the operator ($+, -, \times, \div$) pending execution.
* `waitingForSecondOperand`: A boolean flag to manage input state after an operator has been pressed.
* `chrono`: An array used to store the history of calculations.

The core logic is handled by functions like `inputDigit`, `handleOperator`, `calculate`, and `handleEquals`.
